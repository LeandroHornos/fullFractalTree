# Full Fractal Tree

Simple fractal Tree generator using vanilla JS and canvas. 
The algorithm generates branches iteratively. In each iteration, the branch gets shorter, thinner, and twisted in a certain angle. Two branches emerge from each node, and one green leaf emerges from the end of each branch. Iteration stops when new branches become shorter than a threshold value.
Use the select menus at the top to choose from different twist angles and shortening rates to generate different shapes of trees.
